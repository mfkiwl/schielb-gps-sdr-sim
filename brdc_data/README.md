This is where extra data can be found as you download it from [NASA](https://cddis.nasa.gov/archive/gnss/data/daily/)

If downloading manually, be sure to select the folder of the year that you want, then scroll down to the bottom and select the 'brdc' folder. Select the 'brdcDDD0.YY.Z (or .gz) file where DDD refers to the day of the year (range 1-365/6) and YY refers to the year (range (19)92-(20)22). Uncompress the brdc file and store it in this directory.
